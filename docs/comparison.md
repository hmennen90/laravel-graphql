# Comparison with established packages

This package is **new and still evolving**. The tables below position it honestly
against the established options — they clarify *where it fits*, not that it is more
mature than long-standing projects.

!!! tip "Key differentiator — single source of truth"
    Unlike SDL-first stacks (e.g. Lighthouse), this package does **not** require you
    to implement a type twice. In a typical Lighthouse app the shape of an entity
    lives in **several places at once** — the SDL type, the Eloquent model, and
    often an extra PHP type/transformer or a pile of schema directives. Here a type
    is declared **once** (SDL *or* code-first *or* attributes) and resolvers are
    plain callables that read straight from your models or arrays. No SDL⇄model
    mirroring, no directive DSL to keep in sync.

## Every difference, by package

### vs. nuwave/lighthouse (SDL-first)

- **No double implementation.** Lighthouse: the entity shape lives in the SDL type
  *and* the Eloquent model *and* often a transformer/type class. Here: one
  declaration, resolvers read your model directly.
- **No directive DSL.** Lighthouse expresses behaviour through schema directives
  (`@field`, `@all`, `@paginate`, `@can`, `@rules`, …). Here behaviour is plain PHP
  callables — nothing new to learn, full IDE support, easy to debug/step through.
- **Own engine.** Lighthouse runs on `webonyx/graphql-php`; this ships its own
  lexer/parser/validator/executor, so there is one fewer third-party dependency.
- **Schema styles.** Lighthouse is SDL-only; this also supports code-first and
  attribute-driven schemas that compile to the same internal schema.
- **Trade-off.** Lighthouse has a far larger directive ecosystem, more validation
  rules, mature subscriptions and a big community. This package is younger and
  intentionally smaller.

### vs. rebing/graphql-laravel (code-first)

- **Less boilerplate.** rebing requires a class per Type/Query/Mutation extending
  framework base classes. Here you can define fields inline, via closures, via a
  fluent builder, via attributes, *or* via SDL.
- **Own engine** vs. webonyx underneath rebing.
- **Hybrid** — you are not locked into code-first; mix SDL and attributes freely.
- **Trade-off.** rebing is mature and widely used; its class structure can be a plus
  for very large schemas.

### vs. webonyx/graphql-php (engine only)

- **Framework integration.** webonyx is framework-agnostic — you wire the HTTP
  endpoint, config, error handling, GraphiQL and subscriptions yourself. This ships
  all of that for Laravel out of the box.
- **This is not a wrapper.** It does not depend on webonyx; the engine is a separate
  hand-written implementation of the spec algorithms.
- **Trade-off.** webonyx is the de-facto, battle-tested engine with the most
  complete spec coverage. This engine implements the comprehensive validation
  rule set and a smaller (built-in) directive set.

## When to choose which

- **This package** — you want one dependency-light package that avoids SDL⇄model
  duplication, lets you pick SDL / code-first / attributes per type, and runs on a
  modern PHP 8.4 / PHPStan level 10 codebase; and you can live with a young project.
- **Lighthouse** — you want the largest ecosystem, a rich directive toolkit and the
  most mature realtime subscriptions, and you are comfortable with SDL-first.
- **rebing/graphql-laravel** — you prefer a mature, class-based code-first approach.
- **webonyx/graphql-php** — you need the engine outside Laravel.
